Python Commands :

//When you want to run backend, then be on main project directory(i.e root) and hit this :

-->  python scripts/start/start_backend.py



//When you created a table and needed to update the DB :

-- 1. alembic current*
	
	e.g: aae9038ea23c (head)
             This tells you:

             aae9038ea23c is your current database revision ID
             (head) means you're at the latest migration

-- 2. alembic history*

	If you want to see all migrations leading to this point (basically whole history)

-- 3. alembic downgrade -1

	Go back one version

-- 4. alembic downgrade f244a36a92bb (<- e.g revision ID)

	Go to a specific version

-- 5. alembic revision --autogenerate -m "Description"*
	
	After making model changes in Code

-- 6. alembic upgrade head*

	Update to latest
